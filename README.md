# sappho-poem-generator
A random generator using fragments/poems written by Sappho

## Translations Credit
Translations of Sappho's poetry are credited to:

## Note
This is my first-ever coding project! Which also means that it is a work-in-progress. Some things might not be perfect, but as I learn more about coding, my goal is to update the poetry generator to reflect how I really want it to look like (so forgive me if it looks really basic right now ðŸ˜‚).
